# GOA-Arabic-Text-Summarization

Project Title: A novel gravity ‎optimization approach for extractive ‎Arabic text summarization.

This project was built through the cooperation of three researchers from the ‎Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Technology- Iraq, Dr.  ‎Ayad R. Abbas, Dr. Mustafa J. Hadi,  and Osamah Y. Fadhil. ‎
Where this project aims to summarize Arabic text with ‎single documents ‎using Gravitational Optimization Algorithm (GOA), a powerful metaheuristic ‎‎approach ‎based on the ‎law of ‎gravity, to address the challenge of extractive ‎summarizing Arabic texts‎.‎
